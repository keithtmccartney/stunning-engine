## Tips/Run

* Abc;

## Errors Experienced

* Port-level problems against running the API, both on the suggested 8787 but also on 80, 443, and the default 5000 & 5001; I need to work through this;
* A problem arose in the generating of the Identity Server Principal Claim logic, which resulted in: "cannot convert from 'string' to 'System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal'" on the line "await HttpContext.SignInAsync(user.Id, user.UserName, props);"; I need to work through this;
